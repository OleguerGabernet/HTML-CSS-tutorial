		<h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
		<!--h2>But it doesn't have to be</h2>
		<h3>Needs to be as hard as possible</h3>
		<h4>So nobody but you can learn it</h4>
		<h5>Because you are a genius</h5>
		<h6>not really though</h6-->
		<p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

		<h2>Headings</h2>
		<p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six level headings.</p>

		<h2>Lists</h2>
		<p>This is how you make unordered lists:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
			<li> Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
			<li> They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
			<li><p>This is how you make unordered lists:</p></li>
			
		</ul>

		<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
			<li>but, the list item elements are the same</li>
			<li>Also note how the number increment on their own</li>
			<li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because a this is an ordered list.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Inline elements</h2>
		<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
		<p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or a phrase.</p>
		<p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

		<h2>Empty elements</h2>

		<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
